# Al-based-Generative-design-of-Hydropower-plants.

*Problem Description:*
The proposed system focuses on AI-based Generative Design of Hydropower Plants, integrating civil structures, hydro-mechanical, and electro-mechanical equipment into an automated design workflow. The core idea is to leverage Blender software in combination with Python programming to create intelligent, parameter-driven 3D models of hydropower plant components.

Users will be able to provide inputs either through keyboard entry or via a voice assistant interface powered by OpenAI Whisper. These inputs, which may include specifications such as dimensions, capacity requirements, or site-specific constraints, will be processed to dynamically generate or adapt pre-loaded templates within Blender. The result is a customized 3D model that meets the client’s requirements with high accuracy and efficiency.

By automating the generative design process, this project eliminates repetitive manual modeling, accelerates the design cycle, and reduces the possibility of human error. It also provides scope for AI-driven optimization, where design variations can be evaluated for performance, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. Ultimately, this system will serve as a smart design assistant for engineers and planners, enabling rapid prototyping and visualization of hydropower infrastructure.
